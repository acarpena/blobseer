If you're interested I also ported fsstress from the XFS test suite to 
build/work without XFS. It does some different tests from fsx/doio,
basically all VFS operations on a tree of files and i found some bugs
with it in the past. 

It's in ftp://zero.aec.at/pub/ak/stress/xfsstress-noxfs.tar.gz

If the XFS group doesn't mind it may make sense to put it into LTP too.
