Gfarm (Grid Datafarm) provides a user-level grid filesystem and
parallel process management based on file-affinity scheduling.

The filesystem can be accessed by either every existing
dynamically-linked program (please read README.hook.{en,ja} in
the document directory to do this), or programs which are using
Gfarm file access API.
Parallel process scheduling and invokation are done by gfrun command.
