Gfarm (Grid Datafarm) provides a user-level grid filesystem and
parallel process management based on file-affinity scheduling.

The filesystem can be accessed by either every existing
dynamically-linked program (please read README.hook.{en,ja} in
the document directory to do this), or programs which are using
Gfarm file access API.
Parallel process scheduling and invokation are done by gfrun command.

If this package is configured with globus, don't forget to configure
your environment by the following procedure:
	on Bourne shell:
		GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus
		export GLOBUS_LOCATION
		. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh 
	on csh:
		setenv GLOBUS_LOCATION /usr/local/globus
		. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh
