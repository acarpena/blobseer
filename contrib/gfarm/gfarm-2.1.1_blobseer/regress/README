TO RUN TEST

1. "/tmp" directory must exist and must be writable by the user who will
  run this test.
  e.g. the following should be done by a gfarm administrator:
	gfmkdir /tmp
	gfchmod 777 /tmp

2. run "make check"

TO WRITE TEST
- each test should be independent from other test.
i.e.
- each test shouldn't assume the order of the tests.
- each test should clear the changes made by the test before exiting.

TODO
- test by root?
- make
