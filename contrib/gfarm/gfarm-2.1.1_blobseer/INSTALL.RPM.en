		Gfarm Filesystem Installation Manual

About this document
===================

This document describes the installation of a Gfarm filesystem
using RPM binary packages.

Overview
========

To introduce a Gfarm filesystem, RPM packages for a metadata server,
filesystem nodes, and client nodes have to be installed.

Note that it is possible to install all RPM packages on the same host.

Installation of a Gfarm metadata server
=======================================

Install RPM packages for the Gfarm metadata server.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm-server-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-libs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

Note: The binary package names may be gfarm-gsi-* not gfarm-* if the
      Package does include GSI authentication.

Installation of a Gfarm filesystem node (and client node)
=========================================================

Install the RPM packages for a Gfarm filesystem node.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm-fsnode-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-libs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-client-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-doc-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

Since each filesystem node is usually a client node, it is necessary
to install a client package, too.  A document package is optional.

Moreover, if you want to use the GfarmFS-FUSE (gfarm2fs) to mount
the Gfarm filesystem as a client node, the gfarm2fs package is
necessary.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm2fs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

Installation of a Gfarm client node
===================================

Install RPM packages for a Gfarm client node.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm-client-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-libs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-doc-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

A document package is optional.

If you want to use the GfarmFS-FUSE to mount the Gfarm file system,
install the gfarm2fs package as well.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm2fs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm
