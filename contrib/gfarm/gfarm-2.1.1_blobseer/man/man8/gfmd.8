.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfmd\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfmd\fR is a Gfarm filesystem metadata server for accessing
the filesystem metadata of the Gfarm filesystem.  \fBgfmd\fR must
be running on a metadata server node in advance.

It is possible for \fBgfmd\fR to be executed as a non-privileged user
process, although only the user that executes the \fBgfmd\fR can be authenticated.
Other users cannot use it.
For details, see SETUP.private.en document
.PP
To access gfmd, 
the hostname and the port number should be
specified by the metadb_server_host and metadb_server_port statements,
respectively, in \fI~/.gfarm2rc\fR
or in \fI%%SYSCONFDIR%%/gfarm2.conf\fR
on a client node.
