.SH NAME
gfimport_fixed \- divide and register a fixed-size data file
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfimport_fixed\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIfile\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfimport_fixed\fR is a sample program for dividing a file to file
fragments and registering it to the Gfarm filesystem.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-H\fR
\fIhostfile\fR
specifies a hostname list of filesystem nodes.  The \fIhostfile\fR
consists of a hostname of a filesystem node in each line.  The file is
uniformly divided into file fragments, each file fragment except the
last one having the same size.
if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-f \fIfragment file\fB\fR
specifies a \fIfragment file\fR that consists of a fragment size and a
filesystem node separated by a white space in each line.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used.
.TP
\fB-l \fIrecord size\fB\fR
specifies the size of fixed-size records in bytes.  With this option,
file is divided by the multiple size of the \fIrecord size\fR.
Default size is 1.
.TP
\fB-o \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies an output file.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.SS "IMPORTING BY SPLITTING TO SPECIFIED NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS"
.PP
The following is an example using \fBgfimport_fixed\fR 
to import a \fIsource_file\fR 
as \fIgfarm:file\fR 
by splitting to 8 fragments.

.nf
gfsched -N 8 | gfimport_fixed -H - -o gfarm:file source_file
.fi
.SS "IMPORTING BY SPLITTING TO SPECIFIED NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS   FOR PARTICULAR PROGRAM"
.PP
The following is an example using \fBgfimport_fixed\fR 
to import a \fIsource_file\fR 
as \fIgfarm:file\fR 
by splitting to 8 fragments
to be processed by \fIgfarm:prog\fR program.

.nf
gfsched -N 8 -p gfarm:prog | gfimport_fixed -H - -o gfarm:file source_file
.fi
.SS "IMPORTING INTO SAME DISPOSITION WITH AN EXISTING GFARM FILE"
.PP
The following is an example using \fBgfimport_fixed\fR
to import a \fIsource_file\fR 
as \fIgfarm:file\fR 
into same disposition with existing file
\fIgfarm:template\fR.

.nf
gfsched gfarm:template | gfimport_fixed -H - -o gfarm:file source_file
