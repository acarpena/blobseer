.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
specifies a list of filesystem nodes.  The \fIhostfile\fR consists of
a hostname of a filesystem node in each line.  The file is almost
uniformly divided into file fragments.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-f \fIfragment-file\fB\fR
specifies a \fIfragment-file\fR that consists of a fragment size in
byte and a filesystem node separated by a white space in each line.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used.
.TP
\fB-o \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies an output file.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.SS "IMPORTING BY SPLITTING TO SPECIFIED NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS"
.PP
The following is an example using \fBgfimport_text\fR 
to import a \fIsource_file\fR 
as \fIgfarm:file\fR 
by splitting to 8 fragments.

.nf
gfsched -N 8 | gfimport_text -H - -o gfarm:file source_file
.fi
.SS "IMPORTING BY SPLITTING TO SPECIFIED NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS   FOR PARTICULAR PROGRAM"
.PP
The following is an example using \fBgfimport_text\fR 
to import a \fIsource_file\fR 
as \fIgfarm:file\fR 
by splitting to 8 fragments
to be processed by \fIgfarm:prog\fR program.

.nf
gfsched -N 8 -p gfarm:prog | gfimport_text -H - -o gfarm:file source_file
.fi
.SS "IMPORTING INTO SAME DISPOSITION WITH AN EXISTING GFARM FILE"
.PP
The following is an example using \fBgfimport_text\fR
to import a \fIsource_file\fR 
as \fIgfarm:file\fR 
into same disposition with existing file
\fIgfarm:template\fR.

.nf
gfsched gfarm:template | gfimport_text -H - -o gfarm:file source_file
