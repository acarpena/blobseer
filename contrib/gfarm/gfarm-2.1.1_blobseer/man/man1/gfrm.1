.SH NAME
gfrm \- remove Gfarm files, directories, or file replicas
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfrm\fR [ \fB-frRnqv\fR ] [ \fB-I \fIfile-section\fB\fR ] [ \fB-h \fIfilesystem-node\fB\fR ] [ \fB-D \fIdomain-name\fB\fR ] [ \fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR ] [ \fB-N \fInum-of-replicas\fB\fR ] [ \fB-j \fInum-of-threads\fB\fR ] \fB\fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrm\fR removes each specified file.  It does
not remove directories unless the \fB-r\fR or
\fB-R\fR option is specified.
\&'.' or '..' cannot be removed.
.PP
When the \fB-I\fR option is specified, \fBgfrm\fR
removes the specified file section.  File section is an architecture
name for executable files, or a fragment index for a regular file.
.PP
With the \fB-h\fR, \fB-D\fR, or
\fB-H\fR option, \fBgfrm\fR removes
file replicas of each specified file or file section on the specified
filesystem node(s).  All file replicas of a file cannot be removed,
unless the \fB-f\fR option is specified.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Even when all file replicas are specified by the
\fB-h\fR, \fB-D\fR, or \fB-H\fR
option, forcibly deletes all the file replica.  In
this case, the specified file will be deleted.
.TP
\fB-j \fInum-of-threads\fB\fR
Specifies the number of threads to delete file replicas
simultaneously.  This option is only available when
\fBgfrm\fR is compiled by an OpenMP C compiler.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Prints file names to be deleted, but does not delete them.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Does not print any verbose message.
.TP
\fB-r, -R\fR
Removes all entries under the directories specified by the
command-line argument recursively.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Prints verbose messages.
.TP
\fB-h \fIfilesystem-node\fB\fR
Specifies a filesystem node from which file replicas will be removed.
With the \fB-I\fR option, a file replica of the specified
file section will be removed.
.TP
\fB-D \fIdomain-name\fB\fR
Specifies a domain name of filesystem nodes on which file
replicas will be removed.  With the \fB-I\fR option, a file
replica of the specified file section will be removed.
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
Specifies a \fIhostfile\fR that lists
filesystem nodes on which file replicas will be removed.  With the
\fB-I\fR option, a file replica of the specified file
section will be removed.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-I \fIfile-section\fB\fR
Specifies the file section to be removed.  File section is an
architecture name, such as sparc-sun-solaris8, for executable files, and
a fragment index for regular files.
.TP
\fB-N \fInum-of-replicas\fB\fR
Specifies the maximum number of file replicas.  If files has more
number of file replicas than specified, reduce the number of file
replicas.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
Displays a list of command options.
