.SH NAME
gfarm_agent \- Gfarm Filesystem Metadata Cache Server
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfarm_agent\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfarm_agent\fR is a cache server for a Gfarm metadata
server that can be shared by multiple hosts and multiple users.
The cache server greatly improves performance and response
time for a Gfarm filesystem by reducing network communication to a
distant metadata server.
.PP
Any number of \fBgfarm_agent\fRs can be running on
different nodes (or even on the same node) at the same time.
Consistency among multiple cache servers and a metadata server is
maintained.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-L \fIlog-level\fB\fR
Specifies a log priority level.  The log output, which priority
is higher or equal to this level, will be sent to syslog or standard error.
Please refer gfarm.conf(5) for the priority levels which can be specified
by this option.
.TP
\fB-P \fIpid-file\fB\fR
Specifies a file name which records the process ID of
\fBgfarm_agent\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-S \fIsyslog-facility\fB\fR
Specifies a syslog facility used to report errors by
\fBgfarm_agent\fR\&.  By default, local0 is used.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Specifies the debug mode.  \fBgfarm_agent\fR runs
in the foreground, not in the background.

If this option is specified and \fB-L\fR is not specified,
the log level is set to "debug".
.TP
\fB-f \fIconfig-file\fB\fR
Specifies a configuration file that is read instead of the default
configuration file.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Specifies the master mode.  This improves metadata access
performance by caching the path information.  This option is only
available when there is a single \fBgfarm_agent\fR
running.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport-number\fB\fR
Specifies a port number for TCP, to be used by gfarm_agent.
