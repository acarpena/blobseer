.SH NAME
gfmpirun_p4 \- run Gfarm parallel programs with mpirun
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfmpirun_p4\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIargs\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfmpirun_p4\fR executes a parallel command on
filesystem nodes with mpirun provided by MPICH/p4, which is determined
by the \fB-G\fR option, the \fB-H\fR option, or
the \fB-N\fR option.
.PP
\fB-G\fR, \fB-H\fR, and
\fB-N\fR options are exclusive.  When none of
\fB-G\fR, \fB-H\fR, and \fB-N\fR
options are not specified, \fBgfmpirun_p4\fR schedules
filesystem nodes by the file-affinity scheduling using the first
existent Gfarm file in the argument list
\fIargs\fR.
.PP
\fICommand\fR can be specified by a gfarm-URL
that is registered using gfreg(1).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-G \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file \fIgfarm-URL\fR for
file-affinity scheduling.
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
specifies a \fIhostfile\fR that lists
filesystem nodes.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host
list.
.TP
\fB-N \fInp\fB\fR
specifies the number of nodes \fInp\fR, which
are selected by the increasing order of load average.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBgfmpirun_p4\fR can only work with the
MPICH/p4.
