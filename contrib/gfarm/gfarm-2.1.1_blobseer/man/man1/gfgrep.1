.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfgrep\fR is a sample program of parallel applications executed by
gfrun(1) as well as an example to create a Gfarm file in the local
file view.

\fBgfgrep\fR searches a \fIpattern\fR from \fIinput-gfarm-URL\fR, and
outputs to \fIoutput-gfarm-URL\fR.
.PP
Every parallel application executed by \fBgfrun(1)\fR should interpret the
\fB-I\fR and \fB-N\fR options that show the rank and
the size of the parallel program, respectively, and
call \fBgfs_pio_set_local()\fR.
