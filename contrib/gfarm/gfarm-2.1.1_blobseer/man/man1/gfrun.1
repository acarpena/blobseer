.SH NAME
gfrun, gfrsh, gfssh \- run Gfarm parallel programs
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfrun\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR


\fBgfrsh\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR


\fBgfssh\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrun\fR executes a parallel command on
filesystem nodes, which is determined by the \fB-G\fR
option, the \fB-H\fR option, or the \fB-N\fR
option.
.PP
The \fB-G\fR option specifies the
\fIgfarm-URL\fR, which will be used by
file-affinity scheduling.  In this case, \fBgfrun\fR
schedules the same number of filesystem nodes as the number of
Gfarm fragments, taking into consideration the physical locations of
each fragment replica of the Gfarm file, and filesystem node status.
The \fB-H\fR option specifies the
\fIhostfile\fR that lists filesystem nodes.  The
\fB-N\fR option specifies the number of filesystem
nodes.
.PP
The \fB-G\fR, \fB-H\fR, and
\fB-N\fR options are exclusive.  When none of the
\fB-G\fR, \fB-H\fR, or \fB-N\fR
options are specified, \fBgfrun\fR schedules
filesystem nodes by file-affinity scheduling using the first
existent Gfarm file in the argument list, \fIargs\fR\&.
If there are no existent Gfarm files in the argument list, an
appropriate filesystem node is selected to be executed.
.PP
\fBgfrsh\fR and \fBgfssh\fR utilize
rsh and ssh, respectively, instead of gfrcmd.
.PP
A \fIcommand\fR can be specified by a gfarm-URL
that is registered using gfreg(1).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-G \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
Specifies a Gfarm file \fIgfarm-URL\fR for
file-affinity scheduling.
Please read the DESCRIPTION section about how file-affinity scheduling
works.
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
Specifies a \fIhostfile\fR that lists filesystem nodes.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-N \fInp\fB\fR
Specifies the number of nodes, \fInp\fR, which
are selected in the increasing order of load average.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Specifies an on-demand replication mode.  In this mode, every
file will be replicated before it is accessed remotely.
.TP
\fB-o \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
Specifies a Gfarm file that the standard output of the executed
program will be redirected to.
.TP
\fB-e \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
Specifies a Gfarm file that the standard error of the executed
program will be redirected to.
.TP
\fB-I \fIfragment-index\fB\fR
Specifies a Gfarm fragment index executed by the gfrun command.
This option is available only when either file-affinity scheduling is
selected by the \fB-G\fR option or a gfarm file in the
argument list, or the \fB-N\fR option is specified.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Displays error message verbosely.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
Displays the elapsed time of each Gfarm parallel I/O API after the
program terminates.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
Explicitly specifies that the command is a Gfarm program.
Gfarm specific options will be passed to the command as the result.
.TP
\fB-u\fR
Explicitly specifies that the command is an ordinary program, and
does not take Gfarm specific options.
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Specifies global file view as the default file view for programs
linked with the Gfarm syscall-hooking library.  If this option is not
specified, the default is local file view.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
Displays a list of command options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBGFRUN_CMD\fR
Specifies a remote shell command.  If globus-job-run is specified,
gfrun executes each process using globus-job-run.
