.SH NAME
gfs_glob \- find path names matching a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <gfarm/gfarm.h>
.sp
char *gfs_glob (const char * \fIpattern\fB, gfarm_stringlist * \fIpaths\fB, gfs_glob_t * \fItypes\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfs_glob()\fR searches for all the path names
matching \fIpattern\fR that may include a wildcard,
and returns \fIpaths\fR.
.PP
The returned path names are accessed by
gfarm_stringlist_length(3) and gfarm_stringlist_elem(3).
.PP
It is necessary to allocate memory space dynamically pointed to
by \fItypes\fR using
\fBgfs_glob_init(3)\fR before calling
\fBgfs_glob(3)\fR.  The allocated memory space needs to
be free'ed by gfs_glob_free(3).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP
\fBNULL\fR
The function terminated successfully.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NO_MEMORY\fR
Insufficient memory was available.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_PATHNAME_TOO_LONG\fR
Too long pattern or path name to process.
.TP
\fBOthers\fR
An error except the above occurred.  The reason is shown by its
pointed strings.
