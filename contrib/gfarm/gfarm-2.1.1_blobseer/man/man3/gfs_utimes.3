.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <gfarm/gfarm.h>
.sp
char *gfs_utimes (const char * \fIgfarm_url\fB, const struct gfarm_timespec * \fItsp\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfs_utimes()\fR sets the access and
modification times of the file pointed to by the
\fIgfarm_url\fR argument to the value of the
\fItsp\fR argument.  The \fItsp\fR
argument is an array of gfarm_timespec structures.  The first array
member represents the access time, and the second member represents
the modification time.  The gfarm_timespec structure is:

.nf
	struct gfarm_timespec {
		unsigned int tv_sec;	/* seconds */
		unsigned int tv_nsec;	/* nanoseconds */
	};
.fi
.PP
If the \fItsp\fR argument is a null pointer,
the access and modification times of the file are set to the current
time.
