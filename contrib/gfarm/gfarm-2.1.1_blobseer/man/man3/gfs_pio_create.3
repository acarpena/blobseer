.TH "GFS_PIO_CREATE" "3" "13 November 2006" "Gfarm" ""

.SH NAME
gfs_pio_create \- create a Gfarm file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <gfarm/gfarm.h>
.sp
char *gfs_pio_create (char * \fIgfarm_url\fB, int \fIflags\fB, mode_t \fImode\fB, GFS_File * \fIgfp\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfs_pio_create()\fR creates a new Gfarm file whose name is the
string pointed to by \fIgfarm_url\fR with the access mode \fImode\fR,
and returns a \fIGFS_File\fR structure to the address pointed to by
\fIgfp\fR\&.  \fIMode\fR specifies the file permissions to be created,
and is modified by the process's umask\&.
.PP
The
\fIflags\fR
argument has the same meaning as the second argument of
\fBgfs_pio_open()\fR, including the point
such that exactly one of
\fIGFARM_FILE_RDONLY\fR,
\fIGFARM_FILE_WRONLY\fR, and
\fIGFARM_FILE_RDWR\fR
should be specified.
In addition, it is possible to specify
\fIGFARM_FILE_EXCLUSIVE\fR\&.
With this flag, 
\fBgfs_pio_create()\fR
will fail when the file already exists.
.PP
Note that
\fIGFARM_FILE_TRUNC\fR
must be explicitly specified by the
\fIflags\fR
argument since gfarm-1.0.4, if it's needed.
Although this was implicitly assumed before.
.PP
When \fBgfs_pio_create()\fR is used by parallel processes executed by
gfrun(3) or gfmpirun_p4(3), each process should specify a consistent
value for \fImode\fR\&.  The returned GFS_File structure of each
process has individual file pointers among parallel processes.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP
\fBNULL\fR
The function terminated successfully.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NO_MEMORY\fR
Insufficient memory was available.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_AUTHENTICATION\fR
User authentication failed when connecting to gfmd(8) or gfsd(8).
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED\fR
The requested access to the file is not allowed, or one of the
directories in \fIgfarm_url\fR did not allow search (execute)
permission, or the file did not exist yet and write access to the
parent directory is not allowed.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS\fR
\fIgfarm_url\fR already exists and GFARM_FILE_EXCLUSIVE was used.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_IS_A_DIRECTORY\fR
\fIgfarm_url\fR refers to a directory.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT\fR
A component used as a directory in \fIgfarm_url\fR does not exist.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NOT_A_DIRECTORY\fR
A component used as a directory in \fIgfarm_url\fR is not, in fact, a
directory.
.TP
\fBOthers\fR
An error except the above occurred.  The reason is shown by its
pointed strings.
