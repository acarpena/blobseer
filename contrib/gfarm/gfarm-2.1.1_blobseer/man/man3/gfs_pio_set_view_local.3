.TH "GFS_PIO_SET_VIEW_LOCAL" "3" "18 March 2003" "Gfarm" ""
.SH NAME
gfs_pio_set_view_local \- change file view to the corresponding fragment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <gfarm/gfarm.h>
.sp
char *gfs_pio_set_view_local (GFS_File \fIgf\fB, int \fIflags\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfs_pio_set_view_local()\fR changes the process's view of the data
in the file specified by \fIgf\fR to a file fragment in the local file
view.  The local file view model assumes each process has its own file
fragment which is specified by the argument \fInode\fR of
\fBgfs_pio_set_local(3)\fR.
.PP
The total number of file fragments is also specified by the argument
\fInnode\fR of \fBgfs_pio_set_local(3)\fR.  If it is different from
the total fragment number of the existent file, it is erroneous.
.PP
Before changing to the local file view, it is necessary to call
\fBgfs_pio_set_local(3)\fR in advance.
.PP
Values of \fIflag\fR are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive-OR of
GFARM_FILE_SEQUENTIAL,
GFARM_FILE_REPLICATE,
and
GFARM_FILE_NOT_REPLICATE.
For details, refer to \fBgfs_pio_set_view_index(3)\fR.
.PP
By default, Gfarm files are accessed as a whole file in global file
view where each fragment can be seamlessly accessed.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP
\fBNULL\fR
The function terminated successfully.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NO_MEMORY\fR
Insufficient memory was available.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED\fR
The file is not a fragmented file.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_FRAGMENT_NUMBER_DOES_NOT_MATCH\fR
The total number of file fragments is different from the existence
one.
.TP
\fBOthers\fR
An error except the above occurred.  The reason is shown by its
pointed strings.
