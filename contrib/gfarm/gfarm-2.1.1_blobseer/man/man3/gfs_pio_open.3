.SH NAME
gfs_pio_open \- open a Gfarm file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <gfarm/gfarm.h>
.sp
char *gfs_pio_open (char * \fIgfarm_url\fB, int \fIflags\fB, GFS_File * \fIgfp\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfs_pio_open()\fR opens the Gfarm file whose name is the string
specified by \fIgfarm_url\fR, and returns a \fIGFS_File\fR structure
to the address pointed by \fIgfp\fR\&.
Values of \fIflags\fR are constructed by a
bitwise-inclusive-OR of the following list.  Exactly one of the first
three values should be specified:
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_RDONLY\fR
Open for reading only.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_WRONLY\fR
Open for writing only.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_RDWR\fR
Open for reading and writing.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_TRUNC\fR
If the file already exist and is a regular file, it will be
truncated to length 0 if the open mode allows writing.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_APPEND\fR
The file is opened in append mode.
.PP
The following may be specified as a hint for efficient execution:
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_SEQUENTIAL\fR
File will be accessed sequentially.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_REPLICATION\fR
File may be replicated to a local filesystem when accessing
remotely.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_NOT_REPLICATION\fR
File may not be replicated to a local filesystem when accessing
remotely.
.TP
\fBGFARM_FILE_NOT_RETRY\fR
When the selected file replica does not exist or cannot be
accessed by some reason, open will fail without trying to access
another file replica.
.PP
GFARM_FILE_REPLICATION and
GFARM_FILE_NOT_REPLICATION cannot be specified at
the same time.
.PP
When \fBgfs_pio_open()\fR is used by parallel processes executed by
gfrun(3) or gfmpirun_p4(3), the returned GFS_File structure of each
process has individual file pointers among parallel processes.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP
\fBNULL\fR
The function terminated successfully.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NO_MEMORY\fR
Insufficient memory was available.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_AUTHENTICATION\fR
User authentication failed when connecting to gfmd(8) or gfsd(8).
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED\fR
The requested access to the file is not allowed, or one of the
directories in \fIgfarm_url\fR did not allow search (execute)
permission.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_IS_A_DIRECTORY\fR
\fIgfarm_url\fR refers to a directory.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT\fR
A component used as a directory in \fIgfarm_url\fR does not exist.
.TP
\fBGFARM_ERR_NOT_A_DIRECTORY\fR
A component used as a directory in \fIgfarm_url\fR is not, in fact, a
directory.
.TP
\fBOthers\fR
An error except the above occurred.  The reason is shown by its
pointed strings.
