		Private Gfarm Filesystem Setup Manual

About this document
===================

This document describes how to configure a private Gfarm filesystem by
a non privileged user.

If problems occur, please refer to the Trouble Shooting section
in Gfarm-FAQ.en.

Overview
========

Install the Gfarm software from the source code, and configure a
metadata server, and filesystem nodes.

Gfarm installation from the source code
=======================================

This document assumes the installation directory to be
$HOME/local/gfarm_v2, which is specified by the environment variable
PREFIX.

	% export PREFIX=$HOME/local/gfarm_v2

Configure and install the Gfarm file system from the source code.

	% ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
	% make
	% make install

For details, refer to INSTALL.en document.

Configuration of a Gfarm metadata server
========================================

o Configuration of the Gfarm filesystem

At first, add a binary directory of the Gfarm file system, and change
to the $PREFIX directory.

	% export PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
	% cd $PREFIX

Run 'config-gfarm' to configure a Gfarm filesystem.

	% config-gfarm --prefix $PREFIX -S -m <gfmd_port> -p <db_port>

  where <gfmd_port> is a listening TCP port number of the gfmd, and
  <db_port> is a listening TCP port number of a backend database.  It
  is necessary to use a port number of 1024 or greater for a non
  privileged user.  <gfmd_port> needs to be accessed from outside by
  TCP.  The -S option specifies to configure a private Gfarm file
  system for a non priviledged user.

config-gfarm creates a Gfarm configuration file,
$PREFIX/etc/gfarm2.conf, $PREFIX/etc/gfsd.conf and
$PREFIX/etc/gfmd.conf.

Create a shared secret key (~/.gfarm_shared_key) in the home directory.

	% cd
	% gfkey -f -p 31536000

  This example sets up an expiration date of about one year (31536000
  seconds).

o Firewall configuration

The Gfarm metadata server should be able to accept TCP connections at
a port that are specified by the -m option of the config-gfarm
command.

Configuration of a Gfarm filesystem node
========================================

o Configuration of a filesystem node

When the $PREFIX directory is not shared among the metadata server and
a filesystem node, it is necessary to copy

	$PREFIX/etc/gfarm2.conf
	$PREFIX/etc/gfsd.conf
	$PREFIX/etc/usermap

to a $PREFIX/etc directory on the filesystem node.

Execute the following command to configure the filesystem node.

	% config-gfsd --prefix $PREFIX -S -p <gfsd_port> <spool_directory>

  where <gfsd_port> is a listening TCP port number of the gfsd.  It is
  necessary to use a port number of 1024 or greater for a non
  privileged user.  <gfsd_port> needs to be accessed from outside by
  TCP.  The -S option specifies to configure a private Gfarm file
  system for a non priviledged user.

  The last argument of config-gfsd is a spool directory, which stores
  physical files in Gfarm file system.  Note that the spool directory
  should be a non-shared area among filesystem nodes.  If you do not
  specify the directory, it would be $PREFIX/var/gfarm-spool.

o Firewall configuration

Filesystem nodes should be able to accept TCP connections and
UDP packet reception and transmission at the port that is
specified by the -p option of the config-gfsd command.

Also, it requires the same settings as those of the client nodes.

Configuration of a Gfarm client node
====================================

This chapter describes configuration only for a client node.

o Configuration of a client node

Copy /etc/gfarm2.conf from the metadata server to the client node.

Note: This setting can be substituted for copying to ~/.gfarm2rc.

If user's home directory is shared among metadata server and file
system nodes, there is nothing to do.  If not, .gfarm_shared_key
needs to be copied from the metadata server.

o Firewall configuration

Client nodes should be able to initiate TCP connections to the metadata
server, at the port specified by the -m option of the config-gfarm command.
Furthermore, they should be able to initiate TCP connections and
should be able to send/receive UDP packets to filesystem nodes, from the
port specified by the -p option of the config-gfsd command.

Testing of the Gfarm filesystem
===============================

You can check whether the Gfarm filesystem works or not using any client,
since it can be accessed (or shared) by every client node.

o gfls - Directory listing

'gfls' lists the contents of a directory.

	% gfls -la
	drwxrwxr-x gfarmadm gfarmadm          4 Aug 23 06:33 .
	drwxrwxr-x gfarmadm gfarmadm          4 Aug 23 06:33 ..
	drwxr-xr-x tatebe   gfarmadm          0 Aug 22 16:08 tmp

o gfhost - Filesystem node information

'gfhost -M' displays the information for filesystem nodes registered
with the metadata server.

	% gfhost -M
	i386-fedora3-linux 2 linux-1.example.com 600 0
	i386-fedora3-linux 2 linux-2.example.com 600 0
	i386-fedora3-linux 2 linux-3.example.com 600 0
	i386-redhat8.0-linux 1 linux-4.example.com 600 0
	sparc-sun-solaris8 1 solaris-1.example.com 600 0
	sparc-sun-solaris8 1 solaris-2.example.com 600 0
	...

'gfhost -l' displays the status of the filesystem nodes.

	% gfhost -l
	0.01/0.03/0.03 s i386-fedora3-linux 2 linux-1.example.com 600 0(10.0.0.1)
	0.00/0.00/0.00 s i386-fedora3-linux 2 linux-2.example.com 600 0(10.0.0.2)
	-.--/-.--/-.-- - i386-fedora3-linux 2 linux-3.example.com 600 0(10.0.0.3)
	0.00/0.02/0.00 x i386-redhat8.0-linux 1 linux-4.example.com 600 0(10.0.0.4)
	0.10/0.00/0.00 G sparc-sun-solaris8 1 solaris-1.example.com 600 0(10.0.1.1)
	x.xx/x.xx/x.xx - sparc-sun-solaris8 1 solaris-2.example.com 600 0(10.0.1.2)
	...

The second field shows the status of authentication with the filesystem
node.  's', 'g', and 'G' show successful authentication, while 'x'
shows an authentication failure.

'-.--/-.--/-.--' in the first field shows that gfsd has not executed
correctly, and 'x.xx/x.xx/x.xx' shows the filesystem node is probably
down.

For details of the above Gfarm commands, refer to the respective man page.

Further examples of advanced functionality
==========================================

o File replica creation

Each file in the Gfarm filesystem can have several file copies that
can be stored on two and more filesystem nodes.

Multiple file copies of the same file enables access to the file even
when one of the filesystem nodes is down.  Moreover, it enables
prevention of access performance deterioration by allowing access to
different file copies.

The 'gfwhere' command displays the location of file copies, or a replica
catalog, of the specified files.

	% gfwhere .bashrc
	linux-1.example.com

The 'gfrep' command creates file copies.

	% gfrep -s linux-1.example.com -d linux-2.example.com .bashrc
	% gfwhere .bashrc
	linux-1.example.com linux-2.example.com

In this case, '.bashrc' has two copies; one is stored on
linux-1.example.com and the other is stored on linux-2.example.com.
