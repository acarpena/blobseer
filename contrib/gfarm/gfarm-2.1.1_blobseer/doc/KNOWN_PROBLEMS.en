*** General problems with Gfarm

- On some Linux distributions, gfarm programs and gfsd sometimes hang,
  if ldap is specified in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

  This is not a bug of Gfarm itself, but a bug of system supplied libraries.
  More specifically, this problem occurs when the following conditions are
  all satisfied:
  1. A program calls fork(2) system call.
  2. The program calls a function like getpwuid(3) that indirectly calls
    nss_ldap module before calling fork(2).
  3. Both the parent process and the child process of the program call
    such functions after calling fork(2).
  4. The program is linked with pthread library.
  This symptom is observed in Fedora Core 3, Fedora Core 5 and CentOS 4.4,
  but haven't been observed in Red Hat 8.

  Plans for fixes:
	There is no plan to fix this problem, because we haven't yet found
	any valid countermeasure.

- Group permission is implemented, but there is no command for group
  management.

- gfs_pio_sync() doesn't really update the metadata now.

- When a gfsd is stopped unexpectedly while the gfsd is being used to access
  a file via an OPEN operation, the access stops working.

  You have to reopen the file to access it again.

  For example, this symptom happens when the filesystem node, which is
  running the gfsd, is rebooted.

- File view is not implemented.

- The stat API doesn't return the exact file size until the file is closed.

- If a program, which has already begun to use the gfarm library, makes a
  fork(2) system call, either the parent process or child process is allowed
  to
call
  gfarm APIs.  If both of them call a gfarm API, it's possible that the call
  won't work correctly, because requests to a gfsd server from the
  parent process and the child process may be mixed.  This problem may
  occur even if the parent and the child process access different files,
  because the connection to the gfsd server will be shared if the
  connection was established before fork(2), and both files belong
  to the same gfsd server.

  Also, the child process must complete the file access before the
  parent process calls exit(3), if the child process accesses a file
  which was opened by the parent before fork(2).  This is because the
  parent process requests a close operation from the gfsd at the time of
  exit(3).
  Thus, the access from the child process will fail after the parent
  process performs exit(3).

  Furthermore, no close request will be sent to the gfsd, when the
  child process performs a close operation on a file which was opened
  by the parent process before fork(2). Thus, it's possible that step 3
  of the following scenario will fail:
  1. The parent process performs fork(2) while opening many files which belong
    to the same gfsd.
  2. The child process closes all such files.
  3. The child process tries to open many files that belong to the same
    gfsd.
  This is because the close request in step 2 won't be sent to the gfsd,
  and the gfsd is still opening the descriptors of the files in step 1.

- There is no way to stop a replication process.

  Even if you kill a gfrep command, a network copy process cannot be
  stopped until the copy completes for the ongoing file fragment.
  The metadata for the replica won't be updated, though.

- The Gfarm library isn't multithread safe.

- The Gfarm library doesn't support a process that uses multiple user
  privileges with setuid(), seteuid(), setgid() or setegid().

- It's known that some combinations of NFS server and NFS client sometimes
  make sharedsecret authentication fail.

  You can see whether you have this problem or not by trying the following
  command to see if the second field of gfhost output is "x" instead of "s".
	sh -c 'seq 60 | while read n; do gfkey -f; gfhost -l OTHER-HOST; done'
  The "OTHER-HOST" here is a remote host that shares your home directory
  (via NFS) with the machine from which ???on which you are invoking this
command.

  You can work around this problem in one of the following ways:
  - You can use a longer expiration period of the key by using
    the "gfkey -f -p <EXPIRATION_PERIOD_BY_SECOND>" command.
    If you specify a long enough period, key regeneration won't happen
    while you are running a job. The default period is 1 day.
  - You can use "gsi_auth" or "gsi" authentication instead of "sharedsecret".
  - Or, maybe you can change your NFS server to another OS.

  Combinations with which this symptom has been observed:
	NFS server:			NFS client:
	Linux 2.6.12 (Fedora Core 4)	Linux 2.4.20 (RedHat 8)
	Linux 2.6.12 (Fedora Core 4)	Linux 2.6.9  (Fedora Core 3)
	Linux 2.6.12 (Fedora Core 4)	Linux 2.6.11 (Fedora Core 4)

  Combinations with which this symptom has never been observed:
	NFS server:			NFS client:
	Solaris 2.6			Linux 2.4.18 (RedHat 8)
	NetBSD 3.0			Linux 2.4.18 (RedHat 8)

- We don't have manual pages about environment variables supported by Gfarm.
