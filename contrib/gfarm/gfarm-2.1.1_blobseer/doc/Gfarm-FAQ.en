1. General
**********
  1.1 What is Gfarm?

	Please refer to the following URL:

		http://datafarm.apgrid.org/

  1.2 Where can I download Gfarm?

	It is available at the following URL:

		http://sourceforge.net/projects/gfarm/

	Current source code can be obtained by

		$ svn co https://gfarm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gfarm/gfarm_v2/trunk gfarm_v2
		$ svn co https://gfarm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gfarm/gfarm2fs/trunk gfarm2fs

2. Trouble Shooting
*******************
  2.1 We cannot connect to filesystem nodes and/or a metadata server.

	As the default setting, 600/tcp and 600/udp have to be opened for
	filesystem nodes, and 601/tcp have to be opened	for a metadata
	server.

	When 'gfhost -lv' reports 'x.xx/x.xx/x.xx', these filesystem
	nodes cannot be connected by a client using 600/udp.

	The port number can be specified by a command-line option of
	config-gfarm and config-gfsd.  For details,
	refer to the installation manual.

  2.2 "Authentication error" or "no filesystem node" error occurs when
     accessing or replicating files.

	A shared secret key is not set up correctly.  Make sure the
	same shared secret key file (~/.gfarm_shared_key) is located
	on a home directory on all file system nodes.

	If the problem is still there, call administrators of a Gfarm
	file system.  A shared secret key setting might be incorrect
	for a _gfarmfs user.

  2.3 Due to a disk crash, all files in a filesystem node are lost.
     What do we have to do?

	When a filesystem node is down, there is nothing you have to
	do when there is at least one file copy, since the unavailable
	filesystem node is not used.

	However, when you re-join the filesystem node that loses files
	to the Gfarm file system, a problem occurs since invalid
	metadata of lost file replicas remains in a metadata database.
	We have a plan to provide an administration command to re-join
	the filesystem node.

  2.4 Sometimes a gfarm client or gfsd stops without doing anything.

	If your network interface card or your network itself has a
	trouble that lasts more than a few minutes, such symptoms may occur.
	The possibility increases if you are using a wide
	area network for communication between a gfarm client and a server.
	A stopped gfarm client or gfsd is able to exit automatically
	with an error, if you add a "sockopt keepalive" setting to your
	gfarm.conf. The config-gfarm command generates this setting
	by default, since gfarm 1.3.1.

	Or, if you are using "ldap" in /etc/nsswitch.conf on some Linux
	distributions, this problem may occur too.  This problem is
	observed in Fedora Core 3, Fedora Coer 5 and CentOS 4.4, but
	haven't been observed in Red Hat 8.
	The cause of this problem is a bug of system-supplied libraries.
	The detailed condition of this bug is described in KNOWN_PROBLEMS.en.
	For this problem, currently no workaround is known except disabling
	the "ldap" feature.

3. Security
***********
  3.1 It is safe to use Gfarm in an environment that is NOT protected by
     a firewall?

	Gfarm-2.x supports three authentication methods, namely,
	sharedsecret authentication, the gsi_auth method,
	and gsi authentication.
	The sharedsecret authentication and gsi_auth methods are
	not safe enough in the Internet environment.
	Please refer to the next question for further information about this
	issue.

  3.2 What is the difference in sharedsecret authentication,
     the gsi_auth method, and gsi authentication?

	The "sharedsecret" authentication method in Gfarm is authentication
	based on a shared key, which provides only authentication
	service, not data signing and data encryption services. Thus,
	this method still has risks of packet sniffing and TCP
	session hijacking.
	For this reason, we recommend that you use the sharedsecret
	authentication only in a safe environment, protected by a
	firewall.  The reason we provide this authentication
	method is that it is fast, and it does not require you to acquire
	a public key.

	The "gsi" (Grid Security Infrastructure) authentication method is
	authentication based on a public key infrastructure.  Gfarm uses
	the Globus GSI library for this authentication.	Because the
	Globus GSI library supports data encryption, the gsi
	authentication is considered more secure than the sharedsecret
	authentication in Gfarm.  But please note that some exportable
	versions of Globus don't support encryption.  We recommend that you
	confirm that your Globus version does, in fact, support
	encryption.

	The "gsi_auth" method uses the GSI library only for
	the authentication. The actual data communication is not protected
	by data signing or data encryption services with this method.
	Thus, the gsi_auth method has risks of packet sniffing and
	TCP session hijacking, just like sharedsecret authentication.
	For this reason, we recommend you use the gsi_auth method
	only in a safe environment, protected by a firewall.
	The reason we provide this method is that it allows for fast
	data transfer.

	The gsi authentication and gsi_auth methods are only
	available when you use the --with-globus option at thetime you do
	the source code "configure" operation.
	Please see the following URL for more about the GSI:
