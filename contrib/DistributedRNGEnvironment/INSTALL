Steps to follow to install a working environment

 * Install BlobSeer and it's dependencies (see http://blobseer.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=tutorial:main)
   (BlobSeer should be placed into Softwares/ and I suggest you to place in this directory source code directories
   of BlobSeer dependencies, and install the dependencies in ~/deploy as suggest on the wiki)
 * Install client dependencies:
   - havegeBS: HAVEGE 2.0 (see README)
   - egdBS: install egd (http://egd.sourceforge.net/) into Softwares (i.e. decompress it in a new directory in Softwares/)
   - randomBS: no extra dependencies
 * Compile each needed client:
   - edit CMakeLists.txt
   $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
   $ make
 * To compile tools (in each subdirectory):
   $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
   $ make
