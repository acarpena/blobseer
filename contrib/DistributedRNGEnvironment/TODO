HAVEGE 2.0
==========

 * Use havegeBS's CMakeLists.txt to build HAVEGE 2.0 library and make it a dependency of havegeBS
     or make HAVEGE 2.0 an external dependency of havegeBS
 * Make more architecture available through cmake build system (Core2 / Xeon only right now)
 * PersoArchHAVEGE2.0.h : tweak the CORE2 architecture to fit the needs of Windows OS, and
     validate ANDPT constant
