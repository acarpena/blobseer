This is a testing proxy for transferring the data from the user accounting module to blobseer.
The data transferred could a backlist of malicious clients.
The user accounting module is still under development now (21 July) so this proxy is not tested.
However, you can try this proxy by setting up two servers mocking the user accounting module as well as blobseer rpc module.


<<User accounting module >>
javac repServer.java
java repServer

If everything is ok, you should see the message "Server Socket bound!"



<<Blobseer rpc server and proxy>>
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make

After successfully compiled, launch the blobseer rpc server by:
proxy/server
You should see the message "listening".


Now we can test the proxy. The proxy actually does a very simple thing.
It prompts your to input one operator of the four: +, -, *, /.
It reads your input and sends it to the repServer which mocks the user accounting module.
The repServer has two internal number 6 and 2. repServer calculates the result according to the received operator.
Then it sends back the result to the proxy after calculation and the proxy forwards the result to the blobseer rpc server which finally displays the result.
