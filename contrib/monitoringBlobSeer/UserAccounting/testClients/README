This package is developed to create BlobSeer clients that access the system in an illegal way. 

It links against the BlobSeer source code and the C++ logging service.

There are 3 types of malicious operations: 
	- writing to the providers without publishing the version to the version manager
	- publishing to the version manager some writes that don't exist
	- publishing to the version manager a different number of written pages than the one actually written on the providers.
For each malicious operation, a different client can be created. This is done by compiling the following client classes that extend a modified BlobSeer client:
	- client_iw.cpp
	- client_pnw.cpp
	- client_wnp.cpp

The class "malicious_client.cpp" runs any type of client, according to a parameter passed to it at runtime. The client type can be:
	- 0 - normal client
	- 1 - publish no write
	- 2 - write no publish
	- 3 - incorrect writes 



The project is built using CMake.
The configuration file used by CMake is called CMakeLists.txt.

The default configuration provided in the CMakeLists.txt uses the 0.3.1 BlobSeer version and assumes BlobSeer is installed in:
                ~/Work/blobseer/tags/release-0.3.1

The path for the logging client for C++ is set to:
		~/Work/blobseer/contrib/logging_service/logging_client_cpp

If BlobSeer or the logging client are installed somewhere else, the lines that set the values for BLOBSEER_SOURCE_DIR and LOGGING_SOURCE_DIR have to be modified accordingly.


The Makefile can now be generated using the cmake command for unix makefiles:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"


Build the project:

make


The generated classes and libraries can be cleaned using:

make clean


The program can be run in the folowing way:
./$MALICIOUS_CLIENTS_ROOT/client_tests/malicious_client
