The most important environment variables that have to be set are:

USING_G5K - true if the scripts use a Grid5000 reservation and false otherwise

G5K_DEPLOY_HOME - the path to the scripts root folder
This variable is followed by relative paths to all the components that have associated scripts.


SSH options - the CONNECTOR used to access other machines (typically is SSH for non-Grid5000 deployment)

JAVA_HOME - the path to Java

BLOBSEER_HOME - the path to the used BlobSeer distribution used

USER - the user name that executes the scripts

CLUSTERS - variable used only for the deployment on Grid5000

LOCAL_DIR - the path to a local directory on each machine, where the user has rw rights

 RESULTS - the directory which will contain the logs for the executed processes
